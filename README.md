# Welcome to Cocktail Maker ðŸ‘‹

This was a project I completed during my coding bootcamp, and revisited after to implement some additional features and styling. It lets users see and add cocktails with their respective ingredients.

The app was built using Ruby on Rails in the backend and HTML / SCSS in the frontend.

You can check out the app [HERE](https://cocktail-machine-2000.herokuapp.com/)

**Here's a sneak peak of what the app looks like:**
